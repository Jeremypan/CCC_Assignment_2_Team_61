This dataset is based on the Statistical Area Level 4 2016 boundaries, and covers data for individual years between 2011 and 2017. The dataset includes information in the following specified areas of education and employment: Early Childhood - Enrolment and Attendance in Preschool Programs, Non-School Qualifications, Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) Repayments, Highest Year of School Completed, Occupation of Employed Persons, Youth Engagement in Work or Study, Jobs in Australia and Labour Force<br/><br/>\n\nData by Region contains a standard set of data for each region type, depending on the availability of statistics for particular geographies. Data are sourced from a wide variety of collections, both ABS and non-ABS. When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.<br/><br/>\n\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number:
