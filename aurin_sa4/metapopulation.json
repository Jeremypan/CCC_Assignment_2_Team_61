This dataset is based on the Statistical Area Level 4 2016 boundaries, and covers data for individual years between 2011 and 2018. The dataset includes information in the following specified areas of population and people: Estimated Resident Population, Working Age Population, Median Age, Births and Deaths, Population Density, Internal and Overseas Migration, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Overseas Born Proportion, Religious Affiliation and Speaks language other than English.<br/><br/>\n\nData by Region contains a standard set of data for each region type, depending on the availability of statistics for particular geographies. Data are sourced from a wide variety of collections, both ABS and non-ABS. When analysing these statistics, care needs to be taken as time periods, definitions, methodologies, scope and coverage can differ across collections. Where available, data have been presented as a time series - to enable users to assess changes over time. However, when looked at on a period to period basis, some series may sometimes appear volatile. When analysing the data, users are encouraged to consider the longer term behaviour of the series, where this extra information is available.<br/><br/>\n\nThis data is ABS data (catalogue number: 1410.0) used with permission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.<br/><br/>\n\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/1410.0Explanatory%20Notes12013-18?OpenDocument#POPULATION_0\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nNotes: \n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1410.02013-18?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a>.</li>\n<li>Some data values in Data by Region have been randomly adjusted or suppressed to avoid the release of confidential details.</li>\n<li>Where data was not available, not available for publication, nil or rounded to zero in the original data, it has been set to null.</li>\n<li>Columns that did not contain any values for all years in the original data have been removed.</li>\n</ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"yr","type":"String","title":"Year","description":"Year.","stype":"ordinal","categories":[{"key":"2011","label":"2011"},{"key":"2012","label":"2012"},{"key":"2013","label":"2013"},{"key":"2014","label":"2014"},{"key":"2015","label":"2015"},{"key":"2016","label":"2016"},{"key":"2017","label":"2017"},{"key":"2018","label":"2018"}],"filterValue":"2018","isDimension":true},{"name":"sa4_code16","type":"String","title":"SA4 Code 2016","description":"SA4 Code 2016.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"ogc_fid","type":"Integer","title":"Unique Identifier","description":"Unique Identifier.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"est_res_pop_ur_erp_30_jun_p_tot_num","type":"Integer","title":"Estimated Resident Population (Usual Residents, Erp At 30 June) Persons Total No.","description":"Estimated Resident Population (Usual Residents, Erp At 30 June) Persons Total No..","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"pop_density_pop_density_p_p_km2","type":"Double","title":"Population Density Population Density Persons Persons/Km2","description":"Population Density Population Density Persons Persons/Km2.","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"regional_mig_internal_mig_arrivals_num","type":"Integer","title":"Regional Migration Internal Migration Arrivals No.","description":"Regional Migration Internal Migration Arrivals No..","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"regional_mig_ovs_mig_net_mig_num","type":"Integer","title":"Regional Migration Overseas Migration Net Migration No.","description":"Regional Migration Overseas Migration Net Migration No..","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"regional_mig_ovs_mig_departures_num","type":"Integer","title":"Regional Migration Overseas Migration Departures No.","description":"Regional Migration Overseas Migration Departures No..","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"regional_mig_ovs_mig_arrivals_num","type":"Integer","title":"Regional Migration Overseas Migration Arrivals No.","description":"Regional Migration Overseas Migration Arrivals No..","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"regional_mig_internal_mig_net_mig_num","type":"Integer","title":"Regional Migration Internal Migration Net Migration No.","description":"Regional Migration Internal Migration Net Migration No..","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"regional_mig_internal_mig_departures_num","type":"Integer","title":"Regional Migration Internal Migration Departures No.","description":"Regional Migration Internal Migration Departures No..","stype":"ratio","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa4_name16","type":"String","title":"SA4 Name 2016","description":"SA4 Name 2016.","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","where":"(yr IN ('2018'))","feature":{"key":"sa4_code16","geoLevel":"sa4_2016","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[96.81676569599999,-43.740509603,159.109219008,-9.142175977],"featureType":"country","featureInstance":"au","featureName":"Australia","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":[]}}
