Garden admins sign up for an account (user) and then create/edit one or more gardens (listing). The data at any given time is a combination of information provided from a number of original sources up to 2015, some administrative maintenance, and edits provided through self-management.<br/><br/>\n\nThe original data was collected by Dr Darren Phillips and published in 1996 in paper form. There were various state and city lists maintained as HTML lists by Russ Grayson and Fiona Campbell on the ACFCGN website from 2004-2014. During this period other partial directories were created, including the Tasmanian inventory of school Gardens (~2008), the South Australian Eat Well program (~2010), and the listings of Cultivating Community in the Melbourne area (~2011). These and other lists were combined for the first time in a single database in 2012 by John Brisbin. In 2018 ACFCGN was offered support from AURIN (Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network) to upgrade the database and annual survey to allow for better access by academics and other researchers.<br/><br/>\n\nFor further information please contact data@communitygarden.org.au (+61 407 471 565)","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"ogc_fid","type":"Integer","title":"Unique Identifier","description":"ogc_fid","isDimension":false},{"name":"accessibility_features","type":"String","title":"Accessibility features","description":"accessibility_features","isDimension":false},{"name":"brief_description","type":"String","title":"Brief description of the garden","description":"brief_description","isDimension":false},{"name":"caption","type":"String","title":"Additional comments","description":"caption","isDimension":false},{"name":"garden","type":"String","title":"Name of Garden","description":"garden","isDimension":false},{"name":"garden_size_sq_metres_","type":"String","title":"Garden Size (m2)","description":"garden_size_sq_metres_","isDimension":false},{"name":"garden_type","type":"String","title":"Garden Type","description":"garden_type","isDimension":false},{"name":"garden_website","type":"String","title":"Garden Website","description":"garden_website","isDimension":false},{"name":"info_provider","type":"String","title":"Information provider","description":"info_provider","isDimension":false},{"name":"interviewer","type":"String","title":"Interviewer","description":"interviewer","isDimension":false},{"name":"lat","type":"Double","title":"Latitude","description":"lat","isDimension":false},{"name":"listing_flag","type":"String","title":"Listing Privacy Flag","description":"listing_flag","isDimension":false},{"name":"long","type":"Double","title":"Longitude","description":"long","isDimension":false},{"name":"nid","type":"String","title":"Garden ID","description":"nid","isDimension":false},{"name":"postcode","type":"String","title":"Postcode","description":"postcode","isDimension":false},{"name":"primary_contact_name","type":"String","title":"Primary Contact Name","description":"primary_contact_name","isDimension":false},{"name":"public_access","type":"String","title":"Public Accessibility","description":"public_access","isDimension":false},{"name":"secondary_contact","type":"String","title":"Secondary Contact Information","description":"secondary_contact","isDimension":false},{"name":"state","type":"String","title":"State","description":"state","isDimension":false},{"name":"suburb","type":"String","title":"Suburb","description":"suburb","isDimension":false},{"name":"survey_method","type":"String","title":"Survey Method","description":"survey_method","isDimension":false},{"name":"updated_date","type":"Date","title":"Date Data Last Updated","description":"updated_date","isDimension":false},{"name":"wkb_geometry","type":"Geometry","title":"Geometry","description":"wkb_geometry","isDimension":false},{"name":"year_established","type":"String","title":"Year Established","description":"year_established","isDimension":false},{"name":"your_name","type":"String","title":"Data Provider Name","description":"your_name","isDimension":false},{"name":"your_phone","type":"String","title":"Data Provider Phone Number","description":"your_phone","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","spatial":{"bbox":[96.816765696,-43.740509603,159.109219008,-9.142175977]},"states":[]}}
