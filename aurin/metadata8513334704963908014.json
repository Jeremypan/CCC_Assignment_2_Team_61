The data spans over the 2015/16 financial year and is aggregated to the 2016 Statistical Level 4 (SA4) boundaries.\n<br/><br/>\n\nJobs in Australia is a new release that provides aggregate statistics from the recently developed Linked Employer-Employee Dataset (LEED). It provides new information about filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers.<br/><br/>\n\nJobs in Australia describes all job relationships accumulated over the course of a year. This means that job counts in this publication are higher than the estimates of filled jobs published in the quarterly Australian Labour Account, which provides a point-in-time, or stock measure. These statistics about jobs also differ from Labour Force Survey statistics, which estimate the number of people who held a job in each month.<br/><br/>\n\nThe purpose of this publication is to provide new information about the number and nature of filled jobs in Australia, the people who hold them, and their employers. It includes information about multiple job-holding and employment in local areas. Jobs in Australia counts all jobs held during the reference year. This complements and expands on quarterly stock estimates of filled jobs presented in the Australian Labour Account.<br/><br/>\n\nThis data is Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data (catalogue number: 6160.0) used with permission from the ABS.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information on the release please visit the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6160.0Explanatory%20Notes12011-12%20to%202015-16\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note:\n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6160.02011-12%20to%202015-16?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">original data</a>.</li>\n<li>Where data was not published for confidential reasons, \"np\" in the original data, the records have been set to null.</li>\n<li>Total values may be higher than the sum of the published components due to this confidentialisation.</li>\n</ul>","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"sa4_code16","type":"String","title":"SA4 Code","description":"SA4 Code.","isDimension":false},{"name":"median_income_per_job_aud_females","type":"Integer","title":"Median Income per Job Female ($)","description":"Median Income per Job Female ($).","isDimension":false},{"name":"median_income_per_job_aud_males","type":"Integer","title":"Median Income per Job Male ($)","description":"Median Income per Job Male ($).","isDimension":false},{"name":"median_income_per_job_aud_persons","type":"Integer","title":"Median Income per Job Person ($)","description":"Median Income per Job Person ($).","isDimension":false},{"name":"num_jobs_000_females","type":"Double","title":"Number of Jobs filled by Females ('000)","description":"Number of Jobs filled by Females ('000).","isDimension":false},{"name":"num_jobs_000_males","type":"Double","title":"Number of Jobs filled by Males ('000)","description":"Number of Jobs filled by Males ('000).","isDimension":false},{"name":"num_jobs_000_persons","type":"Double","title":"Number of Jobs filled by Persons ('000)","description":"Number of Jobs filled by Persons ('000).","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa4_name16","type":"String","title":"SA4 Name","description":"SA4 Name.","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"sa4_code16","geoLevel":"sa4_2016","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[96.81676569599999,-43.740509603,159.109219008,-9.142175977],"featureType":"country","featureInstance":"au","featureName":"Australia","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":[]}}
